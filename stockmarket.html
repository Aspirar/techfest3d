						VSM is a multiplayer game which is conducted online.
					</li>
					<li>
						 Participants interested need to login to TerraTechnica website and can play this game when it will be put live.
					</li>
					<li>
						 Every participant is given some amount of money(dummy) before he/she starts playing the game i.e. the balance of each participant is credited with a particular amount initially.
					</li>
					<li>
						Here, you can buy and sell dummy shares of various companies.
					</li>
					<li>
						The company listings would be according to BSE(Bombay Stock Exchange).
					</li>
					<li>
						  Participants can view the number of shares and price of each share for every company. (Note: The information would not be real and it is only for the sake of playing game)
					</li>
					<li>
						The machine must not be made from Lego parts, or any readymade Kit, if we find such machine it will be disqualified.

						 Every time a participant buys shares of a particular company, corresponding amount would be deducted from his/her balance.
					</li>
					<li>
						   Participants could also sell their shares, which they own, at current price of the shares.
					</li>
					<li>
						The rate of shares of a particular company is decided according to the growth/decline of the company in Stock Market, news pertaining to that company etc.
					</li>
					<li>
						 The rates will be fluctuating in between the game and would be visible to all the participants.
					</li>
